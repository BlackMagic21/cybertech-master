			<div class="col-md-6"><p>Hi! My name is Daje Murphy and I am currently a student at Year Up Chicago. Year Up is a non-profit organization that assists young adults, like me, to close the opportunity divide in the corporate world. At Year Up I have  obtained soft and hard skills, such as professionalism, public speaking, computer hardware repair and software installation. The skill I am currently focused on is computer hardware repair which would potentially assist me obtaining the A+ certification. However, before hearing about Year Up I was a high school student going in the wrong direction simply because I believed I didnâ€™t have the potential to become successful in the corporate world. That mindset eventually changed once I graduated from high school and heard about Year Up during the process.</p></div>

            <div class="col-md-6"><p>I am currently attending Year Up to study Information Technology and professionalism to earn A+ certification. Throughout the past 11 weeks of training, I have been increasing my knowledge towards Microsoft Word, Hardware, and Web development. I have become known as Professional of the week in Year Up. It will even help me receive an internship in a 500 fortune company the position of Hardware and which I desire to continue through my future career.</p>

            <p>I am passionate to learn more about hardware and to network with different partners.Therefore, I would like to attend in a two year college to receive basic credit to transfer to a four year university to get a bachelor in IT and communication. Also, to extend my education, continue learning Spanish writing to help communicate with different cultures.</p></div>

            <div class="col-md-6"><p>I'm a student at Year Up where I am acquiring skills in the IT field, as well as expanding my network. I am pursuing a track in hardware and programming specialization, more specifically in computer science and game design. I am currently studying different fields of programming and software and have also received a scholarship to take my skills further. I've been testing numerous of games over the last three years and have found an interest in rating the quality of the work that was put into creating it.  Playing games at a young age gave me the influence to create my own in the future through Sony. </p></div>
